                                A little-known virus that causes flu-like symptoms, Covid 19 has been growing in prevalence for the last few months. Cases have skyrocketed in recent weeks and today a vaccine was released to combat the disease.<br>If you haven't received a vaccination yet, or if you are unsure whether or not you may have been exposed, contact your doctor immediately and get vaccinated as soon as possible. This is an important step to take before it's too late.<br>A press release by the doctor's office says the symptoms of Covid 19 are mild. They resemble those of a common off-season virus, making it difficult to diagnose early on.

					<p style="font-family: montaga;"><br><br>The disease is easily transmitted through bodily fluids, and it's advised that anyone who may be exposed should stay away from schools for the time being. Anyone with direct contact with an infected person should also stay home until they have been checked and cleared by medical personnel.<br>The doctor's office also suggests bringing a pair of rubber gloves with you wherever you go. This is not being done to prevent the spread of the disease, but rather to prevent infection from other sources. Until this mystery illness has been solved and contained, it's best to be safe until it can all be figured out and treated accordingly.<br>COVID-19 is an infectious disease that is caused by the coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) that was discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Since Then, Covid-19 has spread across the world and infected over 177 million people while causing over 3 million deaths.  </p>

                    <h3 class="s-content--no-top-padding">Symptoms</h3>

                    <p style="font-family: montaga; text-align: justify">The different variants of covid 19 in different countries have shown different symptoms In different age groups but the symptoms that occur most often are:
					<ul style="font-family: montaga;">
						<li>Headache</li>
						<li>Cough</li>
						<li>Fatigue</li>
						<li>Breathing Difficulties</li>
						<li>Loss of Smell and Taste</li>
					</ul><span style="font-family: montaga;">
					These symptoms occur from one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. Although these symptoms are noticeable in most individuals who have been exposed to the virus one-third of the covid patients do not develop noticeable symptoms. If you have any of these symptoms or you or someone close by develops similar symptoms on behalf of the team at raahat I would request you to get tested as soon as possible and distance yourself from your loved ones to save your and their life</span>
                    </p>
					
					<h3 class="s-content--no-top-padding">Transmission</h3>

                    <p style="font-family: montaga; text-align: justify">Covid-19 is transmitted when individuals are exposed to the virus-containing respiratory droplets and airborne particles exhaled by an infected person, these particles may be inhaled or reach the mouth, nose, or eyes of a person by through touch or direct deposition (coughed on), the chances of infection are highest when people are in close proximity for extended periods of time. Infected people can transmit the virus up to two days before they show symptoms themselves and infected people stay contagious for up to 20 days and can spread the disease even if they remain asymptomatic.

						<p style="font-family: montaga; text-align: justify">The First wave of covid 19 hit India in mid-June of 2020 while the nation while the unlocks had just begun and people were back on the streets, During that time across India there were about ninety thousand cases on a daily at its peak and about twenty thousand cases when the first wave started to recede.</p>
						<p style="font-family: montaga; text-align: justify">The first covid wave relatively affected fewer people than the second wave but for its time it was pretty devastating almost killing around 1.5 l people. The first wave of covid -19 made the people of India aware a bit cautious of the novel virus while also spreading information about the same. </p>

						<p style="font-family: montaga; text-align: justify">The second wave of covid 19 hit India in mid-march of 2021 while all restrictions were relaxed and people almost did not care about the novel virus anymore. During the peak there about 4l cases recorded every single day and about sixty to seventy thousand cases daily at the time of writing this. The second wave has still not receded fully but according to experts it will diminish very soon because of the precautions that are being taken by the government but because of the same precautions the middle and lower classes of society are suffering and their pain is absent is totally absent on all news channels that are supposed to keep the people of India updated on matters like these. </p>

                    <p style="font-family: montaga; text-align: justify">The predicted third wave of the novel coronavirus is according to experts “closer than we think”. The general time gap between 2 waves is roughly four to five months. Across the world, the time gap has varied by a considerable amount. Some have experienced a fresh wave even before 2 months of the previous wave. According to credible sources, the 3rd wave of covid 19 will hit India in mid-September. According to the prediction made by the special task force to tackle covid spread in Maharashtra, the third wave will hit children and young adults the most, almost 10 percent of the total cases will come from children and young adults. <br>Considering all of the laid-out facts and the situations of the country I encourage you to donate now to our fundraiser to help countless lives that have been hit the worst by this pandemic which long from being gone. If you can’t play your part and get vaccinated as quickly as possible
