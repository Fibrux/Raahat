                                An outbreak of the coronavirus in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, rapidly spread across the world with cases being reported from almost all countries. Some places in India, like Kerala, handled the second wave of the coronavirus efficiently but the emergence of new cases is uncertain. Amidst the significant public health risk that COVID-19 poses to the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a public health emergency of international concern.

					<p style="font-family: montaga;color: #f0dec6;"><br><br>Covid-19 has led to a massive loss of human life worldwide and caused major chaos in the economic field. This major disruption has put millions of people at a risk of losing their jobs. Approximately half of the world's 3.3 billion global workforce are at risk of losing their livelihoods. There is a shortage of workers because of lack of social protection and access to quality health care. Numerous agricultural laborers while saving the world faced high levels of poverty, malnutrition and poor health because of their low and irregular incomes, making them unable to provide for their families which explains the high death rate in the rural areas. Approximately half of the world’s 3.3 billion global workforce are at risk of losing their livelihoods. Most economy workers are particularly vulnerable because the majority lack social protection and access to quality health care. The pandemic has also been affecting the entire food systems as border closures hinder trade relations. Many countries such as Pakistan cut off all diplomatic relations with India being more concerned only about themselves. Several countries like Australia, Germany and Belgium etc had even banned Indians from coming to their countries which might have affected the long-distant family relations of people. Some nations agreed to support India but did not take any action. Some countries like the United States and Russia did help India a little by sending three shipments of emergency relief materials. China and India have similar approaches in terms of fundamental rights and feeling empathy for each other. If they work together, they can thrive and overcome this situation. Can India and China take an exploratory step together? Let’s hope
			</p>

                    <p style="font-family: montaga; text-align: justify;color: #f0dec6;">The country had a severe shortage of space in the intensive care units and also immensely lacked beds in hospitals. Delhi, a densely populated region of 20 million people had its hospitals full and had to turn away new patients. Hospitals also experienced acute shortage of oxygen and some hospitals even put up warning signs showing lack of supplies. Some people who did not even need ventilators and oxygen cylinders were stockpiling them out of apprehension. The pandemic had already caused people to remain confined to the four walls of their homes and the news of covid death rates further made their anxiety flare up leading to overthinking, emotional turmoil and downward spiraling of many people’s mental health.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-family: montaga; text-align: justify;color: #f0dec6;">Transgenders too have suffered a lot during lockdown, facing physical as well as mental abuse from their families. But for some of them, social media turned out to be a safe haven allowing them to express themselves without the fear of being judged because a lot of people have become more open minded and accepting of them during this pandemic due to increased awareness. Women have started small businesses for their independent cash flow and women empowerment has also skyrocketed during these tough times. Due to safety norms against this deadly virus, all shops and cafeterias are closed so people are referring to homemade and organic material which encourages women to start small businesses which are being noticed as people are more active on their social media, they are fascinated by the local businesses and as it is more cheap and convenient they prefer them instead of larger brands.
                    </p>
					
                    <p style="font-family: montaga; text-align: justify;color: #f0dec6;">The numbers of covid cases and deaths have never been worse with over 178 million confirmed cases and 3.86 million confirmed deaths worldwide last recorded on 21 June, 2021.These are only the numbers reported from hospitals. The unreported cases, and the people who died on the streets begging for oxygen like a fish out of water should not go unnoticed. There was a severe shortage of oxygen in the country. In India alone we were in need of 14 million oxygen tanks in a day. 90% of the country’s oxygen, 7,500 metric tons, is being given away for medical usage.
                    </p>
					
                    <p style="font-family: montaga; text-align: justify;color: #f0dec6;">We are comparatively freer while at home so we should at the least be taking care of our planet. We should follow the social distancing norms and take precautions by sanitizing our things and wearing a mask at all times. We must eat healthy and exercise daily ,preferably indoors, to keep fit so that we don’t get infected .We must bulk up our supply system by storing oxygen cylinders, ventilators and other things so that if we are forced to tackle anything of this sort ever again, we are prepared to handle it with diligence and ensure that we do not lose any more lives as every life is precious and nobody deserve an untimely death.
