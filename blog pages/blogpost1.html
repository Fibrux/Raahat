                                CORONAVIRUS (Covid-19) is not humanity's first brush with a coronavirus outbreak. A related pathogen, SARS-CoV emerged in Foshan, China, in November 2002. In February 2003, the virus was transported to Hong Kong, and from there, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the disease it causes, spread globally. By May 2004, that epidemic was quelled. In late 2019, the first case of SAR-CoV2 was reported in Wuhan, China. SARS-CoV-2 is crucial, especially because the virus continues to change and adapt as it lingers in human populations around the globe. Scientists should keep in mind that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to a family of viruses that includes pathogens responsible for recent and ongoing epidemics. As of June 18, 2021, there are 178,264,359 cases and 859,364 deaths due to coronavirus (COVID-19). The epidemic began in mainland China, with a geographical focus in the city of Wuhan, Hubei. On Feb 26, 2020, the rate of increase in cases became greater in the rest of the world than inside China.

                <div class="column large-12 intro">
					
					<p style="font-family: montaga;"><br><br>Now, let us talk about how the Coronavirus has impacted us. </p>

                    <h3 class="s-content--no-top-padding">What does the pandemic mean for the global economy?</h3>

                    <p style="font-family: montaga; text-align: justify">If the virus remains for a longer time, analysts fear that the global economy may slip into a recession. Recessions set in when the economy shows two consecutive quarters of contraction. Recession due to the pandemic in countries will bring down the global economic growth to clock in below 2.5%
                    </p>
					
					<h3 class="s-content--no-top-padding">How does this impact the Indian markets?</h3>

                    <p style="font-family: montaga; text-align: justify">When the Chinese suppliers were shut down, the Indian pharmaceutical, automobile and mobile phone industries immediately wobbled. India is dependent on China for the supply of components for the products that the Indian sectors produce. The Indian gem and jewelry makers<span style="font-weight: bold"> lost about $7.75 billion</span> last year due to the partial closure of the Chinese and Hong Kong markets.<br>It is estimated that more than 150 million people across the globe would be pushed into extreme poverty because of the pandemic.
                    </p>
					
					<h3 class="s-content--no-top-padding">Impact on the Education sector</h3>

                    <p style="font-family: montaga; text-align: justify">A huge sector that has been impacted is the education sector. Parents are demanding that private schools should not hike their fees. On the other hand, schools say that they do not possess the money to pay the salaries of the staff and teachers. As of 28th June 2020, there had been nationwide closures of schools and colleges in over 114 countries worldwide, which has affected more than 1 billion students.<br>In India, more than <span style="font-weight: bold">32 crore students</span> have been affected by this. Some schools have stopped teaching entirely while others resorted to online classes. Online classes are a great solution in the short run but they also create a digital divide. They are accessible only for people like us, who have the availability of the internet and suitable appliances but what about the people that do not have internet available to them? How many people are there in India that do not have internet? There are only <span style="font-weight: bold">2 states</span> that at least have <span style="font-weight: bold">40 percent</span> of <span style="font-weight: bold">rural households</span> with internet facilities. <span style="font-weight: bold">Only 23% of Indian households have access to the internet for e-education.</span><br>Constant online classes for 5-6 days, prolonged exposure to the screens with headphones on is not ideal. It is stressful and leads to an increase in anxiety and depression. In some extreme cases, students have shown declining tendencies.
                    </p>
					
					<h3 class="s-content--no-top-padding">The Positive Impact of Coronavirus</h3>

                    <p style="font-family: montaga; text-align: justify">There has been an evident increase in air purity, the water has become cleaner, the pollution levels have fallen. Due to the lockdown, the number of cars plying on the roads has drastically fallen, factories have been shut down and hence, in the cities all over the world, the concentration of nitrogen dioxide in the air is nominal.<br> Even the PM 2.5 (particulate matter 2.5) levels have also reduced. PM 2.5 is the cause of the death of 4 million people every year.<br> Due to the stoppage of the industrial waste, a positive impact has been seen on the water quality of the river Yamuna. There has also been a 40-50% improvement in the water quality of the river Ganga.
                    </p>
					
					<h3 class="s-content--no-top-padding">Conclusion</h3>

                    <p style="font-family: montaga; text-align: justify">To sum up, the economy has fallen, the education sectors have failed. Students are not in their best mental space at the present moment. The only thing we can do to protect ourselves at home is physical exercise and take care of ourselves and our loved ones. There are certain positive impacts of the coronavirus as well but one cannot focus on them amongst the widespread chaos and misery that surround us.<br>Remember, we all are in this together.
